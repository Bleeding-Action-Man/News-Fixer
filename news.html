After many tries, the Patriarch is tired of being outnumbered. So, he's back again, with more friends than before. This is the Patriarch Special!
<br>
With our custom mutator, all participant's perks will be set to level 2. You and your team will be challenged to defeat the Patriarch on suicidal difficulty, or face utter humiliation and shame! You beat him before, can you really do it again?
